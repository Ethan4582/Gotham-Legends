## Important Note
- If you **cannot see the Batman model**, it's because the model file is too large for Vercel to deploy. However, it works perfectly in a local environment.
- Solutions:
  - **Compress the model file** to reduce its size.
  - **Use external hosting services** like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
  - **Utilize model streaming techniques** to dynamically load the model in chunks.
